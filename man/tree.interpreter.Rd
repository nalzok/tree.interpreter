\title{Random Forest Prediction Decomposition and Feature Importance Measure}
\description{
An R re-implementation of the 'treeinterpreter' package on PyPI.
<https://pypi.org/project/treeinterpreter/>. Each prediction can be
decomposed as 'prediction = bias + feature_1_contribution + ... +
feature_n_contribution'. This decomposition is then used to calculate the
Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) and Mean Decrease Impurity using out-of-bag
samples (MDI-oob) feature importance measures based on the work of Li et al.
(2019) <arXiv:1906.10845>.
}
\section{\code{tidyRF}}{

The function \code{tidyRF} can turn a \code{randomForest} or \code{ranger}
object into a package-agnostic random forest object. All other functions
in this package operate on such a \code{tidyRF} object.
}

\section{The \code{featureContrib} and \code{trainsetBias} families}{

The \code{featureContrib} and \code{trainsetBias} families can decompose the
prediction of regression/classification trees/forests into bias and feature
contribution components.
}

\section{The \code{MDI} and \code{MDIoob} families}{

The \code{MDI} family can calculate the good old MDI feature importance
measure, which unfortunately has some feature selection bias. MDI-oob is a
debiased MDI feature importance measure that has achieved state-of-the-art
performance in feature selection for both simulated and real data. It can be
calculated with functions from the \code{MDIoob} family.

library(ranger)
rfobj <- ranger(mpg ~ ., mtcars, keep.inbag = TRUE)
tidy.RF <- tidyRF(rfobj, mtcars[, -1], mtcars[, 1])
MDIoob(tidy.RF, mtcars[, -1], mtcars[, 1])
